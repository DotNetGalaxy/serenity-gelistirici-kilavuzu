# Securing Tenant Selection At Server Side

When you log in with *tenant2* user and open its edit form, *Tenant* selection dropdown is not displayed, so he can't change his *tenant* right? 

Wrong!

If he is an ordinary user, he can't. But if he has some knowledge of how Serenity and its services work, he could.

When you are working with web, you got to take security much more seriously. 

It's very easy to create security holes in web applications unless you handle validations both at client side and server side.

Let's demonstrate it. Open Chrome console, while logged in with user *tenant2*.

Copy and paste this into console:

```js
Q.serviceCall({ 
    service: 'Administration/User/Update', 
    request: { 
        EntityId: 2, 
        Entity: { 
            UserId: 2, 
            TenantId: 1 
        }
    }
});
```

Now refresh the user management page, you'll see that *tenant2* can see admin user now!

We called *User Update* service with javascript, and changed *tenant2* user *TenaNntId* to *1 (Primary Tenant)*.

Let's revert it back to *Second Tenant (2)* first, then we'll fix this security hole:

```js
Q.serviceCall({ 
    service: 'Administration/User/Update', 
    request: { 
        EntityId: 2, 
        Entity: { 
            UserId: 2, 
            TenantId: 2 
        }
    }
});
```

Open *UserRepository.cs*, locate *MySaveHandler* class and modify its *GetEditableFields* method like this:


```cs
protected override void GetEditableFields(HashSet<Field> editable)
{
    base.GetEditableFields(editable);

    if (!Authorization.HasPermission(Administration.PermissionKeys.Security))
    {
        editable.Remove(fld.Source);
        editable.Remove(fld.IsActive);
    }

    if (!Authorization.HasPermission(Administration.PermissionKeys.Tenants))
    {
        editable.Remove(fld.TenantId);
    }
}
```

Build your project, then try typing this into console again:

```js
Q.serviceCall({ 
    service: 'Administration/User/Update', 
    request: { 
        EntityId: 2, 
        Entity: { 
            UserId: 2, 
            TenantId: 1 
        }
    }
});
```

You will now get this error:

```
Tenant field is read only!
```

*GetEditableField* is a method that SaveRequestHandler calls to determine which fields are editable, thus updatable by user. By default, these fields are determined by looking at *Updatable* and *Insertable* attributes of row properties. 

> Unless otherwise specified, all fields are insertable and updatable.

If user doesn't have tenant administration permission, we remove *TenantId* from the list of auto-determined editable fields.
