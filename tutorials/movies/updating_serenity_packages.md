# Updating Serenity Packages

When i started writing this tutorial, Serenity (NuGet packages containing Serenity assemblies and standard scripts libraries) and Serene (the application template) was at version 1.5.4.

When you read this you are probably using a later version, so you might not have to update serenity yet.

But, i want to show how you can update Serenity NuGet packages, in case another version comes out in the future.

I prefer to work with NuGet from *Package Manager Console* instead of using NuGet GUI interface as it performs much faster.

So, click *View -> Other Windows -> Package Manager Console*.

Type:

> Update-Package Serenity.Web

This will also update following NuGet packages in *MovieTutorial.Web* because of dependencies:

```txt
Serenity.Core
Serenity.Data
Serenity.Data.Entity
Serenity.Services
```

To update Serenity.CodeGenerator (containg *sergen.exe*), type:

> Update-Package Serenity.CodeGenerator

Serenity.CodeGenerator is also installed in MovieTutorial.Web project.

Now, let's update script project packages:

> Update-Package Serenity.Script

Serenity.Script package contains three assemblies: *Serenity.Script.Imports*, *Serenity.Script.Core* and *Serenity.Script.UI*, so this updates them all.

> During updates, if NuGet asks to override changes in some script files, you can safely say yes unless you did manual modifications to Serenity script files (which i suggest you avoid).

Now rebuild your solution and it should build successfully.

> From time to time, breaking changes might happen in Serenity, but they are kept to minimum, and you might have to do a few manual changes in your application code. 

> Such changes are documented with a [BREAKING CHANGE] tag in change log at:
> https://github.com/volkanceylan/Serenity/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

> If you still have a problem after upgrade, feel free to open an issue at:
> https://github.com/volkanceylan/Serenity/issues


### What Is Updated

Updating Serenity NuGet packages, takes Serenity assemblies up to the latest version.

It might also update some other third-party packages like ASP.NET MVC, FluentMigrator, Select2.js, SlickGrid etc.

> Please don't update Select2.js to a version after 3.5.1 yet as it has some compability problems with jQuery validation.

Serenity.Web package also comes with some static script and css resources like the following:

```
Content/serenity/serenity.css
Scripts/saltarelle/mscorlib.js
Scripts/saltarelle/linq.js
Scripts/serenity/Serenity.Core.js
Scripts/serenity/Serenity.Script.UI
Scripts/serenity/Serenity.Externals.js
Scripts/serenity/Serenity.Externals.Slick.js

```

So, these and a few more are also updated in MovieApplication.Web.



### What Is Not Updated (OR Can't Be Updated Automatically)

Updating Serenity packages, updates Serenity assemblies and most static scripts, but not all *Serene* template content is updated.

We are trying to keep updating your application as simple as possible, but Serene is just a project template, not a static package. Your application is a customizable copy of Serene.

You might have done modifications to application source, so updating a Serene application created with an older version of Serene template, might not be as easy as it sounds.

So sometimes you might have to create a new Serene application with up-to-date Serene template version, and compare it to your application, and merge features you need. This is a manual process.

> We have some plans to make parts of Serene template also a NuGet package, but it is still not trivial how to update your application without overriding your changes, e.g. to shared code like Navigation items. And what if you removed Northwind code, but our update reinstalls it? I'm open to suggestions...

In the next article i'm going to need some code from 1.5.9 Serene template, and we'll see how to get them into our MovieTutorial application.
