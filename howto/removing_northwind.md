# How To: Remove Northwind From Serene

After you take Northwind as a sample, and develop your own project, you would want to remove Northwind module artifacts from your project. 

Here is how to get rid of it.

We assume your solution name is *MyProject*, so you have *MyProject.Web* and *MyProject.Script* projects in your solution.

Perform steps below in Visual Studio:


### Removing Project Folders

* Remove *MyProject.Web/Modules/Northwind* folder. This will remove all server side code related to Northwind.

* Remove *MyProject.Script/Northwind* folder to remove all script code related to Northwind.


### Removing Navigation Items

* Open *MyProject.Web/Modules/Common/Navigation/NavigationItems.cs*, remove all lines with *Northwind*.

### Removing Migration Scripts

Remove folder *MyProject.Web/Modules/Common/Migrations/NorthwindDB/* with all files under it.

Remove "Northwind" from following line in *MyProject.Web/App_Start/ SiteInitialization.Migrations.cs*:

```cs
private static string[] databaseKeys = new[] { "Default", "Northwind" };
```

Also remove *Northwind* connection string from *web.config*.

### Removing LESS Entries 

* Open *MyProject.Web/Content/site/site.less* file, remove following line:
    
```less
@import "site.northwind.less";
```

* Remove *MyProject.Web/Content/site/site.northwind.less* file.


### Removing Localization Texts

* Open *MyProject.Web/Modules.Texts.cs* and remove following lines:

```cs
            public static LocalText NorthwindPhone = "...";
            public static LocalText NorthwindPhoneMultiple = "...";
```

* Open *MyProject.Web/Scripts/site/site.texts.es.json* and remove all lines with *Northwind*.

* Open *MyProject.Web/Scripts/site/site.texts.tr.json* and remove all lines with *Northwind*.

* Open *MyProject.Web/Scripts/site/site.texts.invariant.json* and remove all lines with *Northwind*.


### Removing Northwind Script Side Generated Code

* Expand *MyProject.Script/Imports/FormContexts/FormContexts.tt*. Select files starting with *Northwind.* and delete them.
 
### Removing Northwind Numbers From Dashboard 

Open *DashboardPage.cs*, remove these using lines:

```cs
using Northwind;
using Northwind.Entities;
```

As Dashboard gets numbers from Northwind tables, you should modify *Index()* action like this:

```cs
[Authorize, HttpGet, Route("~/")]
public ActionResult Index()
{
    var cachedModel = new DashboardPageModel()
    {
    };

    return View(MVC.Views.Common.Dashboard.DashboardIndex, cachedModel);
}
```

> You should replace this model with something specific to your site, and modify DashboardIndex accordingly.

### Building Project and Running T4 (.tt) Templates

* Now rebuild your solution.

* Make sure it is built *successfully* before executing next step.

* Click *Build* menu and click *Transform All Templates*.

* Rebuild your solution again.

* Search for *Northwind* in all solution items. It should find no results.

* Run your project, now Northwind menu is gone.


### Removing Northwind Tables

If you are using Serene 1.6.4.3+ Northwind tables are in a separate database, so you can just drop it. Following steps are unnecessary.


> ### If using a version below Serene 1.6.3, follow these steps:

> * Open *MyProject.Web/Modules/Common/Migrations/DefaultDB/ DefaultDB_20141103_140000_Initial.cs* file, remove following line:


>```cs
> Execute.EmbeddedScript(
>   "MyProject.Modules.Common.Migrations.DefaultDB.NorthwindDBScript.sql");
>```

>* Remove *MyProject.Web/Modules/Common/Migrations/DefaultDB/ DefaultDB_20141123_155100_ProductImage.cs* file.

>* Remove *MyProject.Web/Modules/Common/Migrations/DefaultDB/ DefaultDB_20151014_030700_OrderDetailID.cs* file.

>* Remove *MyProject.Web/Modules/Common/Migrations/DefaultDB/ NorthwindDBScript.sql* file.


> * You would drop your existing database, and let migrations recreate your tables.

> * If you have some data that you don't want to lose in other tables, execute the script below to remove Northwind tables:

>```sql
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[Order Details]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[Orders]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[Products]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[Suppliers]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[Shippers]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[EmployeeTerritories]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[Employees]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[CustomerCustomerDemo]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[Customers]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[Categories]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[Territories]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[Region]
>DROP TABLE [dbo].[CustomerDemographics]
>DELETE FROM [dbo].[VersionInfo] WHERE Version = 20141123155100
>```

> Please make sure the database you are running this script on is a Serene one.
